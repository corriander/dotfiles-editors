README: $VIMRUNTIME directory
=============================

This is where the majority of the Vim configuration lives (only the
.vimrc is outside and that can, I think, be moved in here too if
necessary).

Directories
-----------

The purpose of each of these directories (should be):

  - `after/` : mirrored structure that runs *after* everything else.
    This is the place for tweaking bits of configuration without
	nuking stuff earlier in the load sequence. Note that because this
	happens last, plugin variables won't take effect if they're
	specified here.
  - `autoload/` : not really important to me
  - `colors/` : syntax highlighting
  - `ftdetect/` : filetype-specific instructions for picking up
    non-standard file extensions etc.
  - `ftplugin/` : filetype-specific configuration
  - `syntax/` : syntax definition
  - `vials*/` : directory of plugins/addons managed by T. Pope's
    pathogen (http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen). There is a helper
	script for this called `vials` allowing selective
	enabling/disabling (invaluable for debugging/testing). Enabled
	plugins are symlinked in the `vials-enabled` directory.
